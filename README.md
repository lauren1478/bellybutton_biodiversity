# bellybutton_biodiversity

I found this challenge incredibly difficult and was not able to get anything to show up on the except the hold for filters. I completed the code hoping that something would work along the way. Sometimes the data would show up in the filter and the descriptive summary and then next time I make one change, it would be gone. The bar chart showed up at first but then once I added the bubble, it disappeared. After many frustrating hours, I have decided to submit as much work as possible which is my chart code.
